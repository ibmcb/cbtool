# VApp-specific MANDATORY attributes
DESCRIPTION = Deploys a single VM running the coremark benchmark.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_PROFILE possible values: "default" (the benchmark is always
DESCRIPTION +=run with the following parameters "7 1 2000").\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_LEVEL meaning: number of benchmark iterations, multiplied
DESCRIPTION +=by a "load factor" (default 1000).\n 
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_DURATION meaning: not used, a run ends when all iterations
DESCRIPTION += are finished.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- COMMENT: One of the "Synthetic" Workloads. The coremark benchmark
DESCRIPTION += is CPU (core)-centric and deliberately tries to ignore
DESCRIPTION += I/O and memory effects. During initial setup, the benchmark is compiled 
DESCRIPTION += to run in a specific number of CPUs (this number may vary, since 
DESCRIPTION += VMs can be resized by the cloud).\n
