# VApp-specific MANDATORY attributes
DESCRIPTION =Deploys a single instance running the "coremark" benchmark.\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_PROFILE possible values: _PROFILES_ (the benchmark is\n
DESCRIPTION +=    always executed with the following parameters "7 1 2000").\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_LEVEL meaning: number of benchmark iterations, multiplied\n
DESCRIPTION +=    by a "load factor" (default 1000).\n 
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_DURATION meaning: not used, a run ends when all iterations\n
DESCRIPTION +=    are finished.\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - COMMENT: One of the "Synthetic" Workloads. The coremark benchmark\n
DESCRIPTION +=    is CPU (core)-centric and deliberately tries to ignore I/O and\n
DESCRIPTION +=    memory effects. During initial setup, the benchmark is compiled\n 
DESCRIPTION +=    to run on a specific number of CPUs (this number may vary, since\n 
DESCRIPTION +=    instances can be resized by the cloud).\n
