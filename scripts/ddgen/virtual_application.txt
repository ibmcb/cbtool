# VApp-specific MANDATORY attributes
DESCRIPTION = Deploys a single VM, which will use the "dd" to write a variable 
DESCRIPTION += amount of data (by default from /dev/random) to one of its local file systems.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_PROFILE possible values: "default" (just run a single instance
DESCRIPTION += of the dd process and write data to disk).\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_LEVEL meaning: number of blocks written to disk.\n 
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_DURATION meaning: not used, a run ends when all data (defined
DESCRIPTION += by BLOCK_SIZE * LOAD_LEVEL) is written.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- COMMENT: One of the "Synthetic" Workloads.
DESCRIPTION += The main use case of this Virtual Application type is the
DESCRIPTION += testing of "cloud image capture". By writing a specific amount of
DESCRIPTION += data to an instance's disk, and then capturing the instance onto a
DESCRIPTION += new image, cloud "capture" performance can be measured.
