# VApp-specific MANDATORY attributes
DESCRIPTION = Deploys one or more VMs, and then continuously executes
DESCRIPTION += a variable-length sleep, followed by the reporting of fake 
DESCRIPTION += performance numbers at the end.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_PROFILE possible values: "default" (since this is just
DESCRIPTION += sleep call, multiple profiles don't make any sense).\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_LEVEL meaning: does not matter/do not care.\n 
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_DURATION meaning: the length of the sleep call.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- COMMENT: One of the "Synthetic" Workloads. 
DESCRIPTION += This a very useful workload to test a Cloud's management/
DESCRIPTION +=infrastructure in an "ideal" or "baseline" scenario (without
DESCRIPTION += any resource starvation from workloads on compute nodes). 
DESCRIPTION += The fact that, despite not executing any actual meaningful 
DESCRIPTION += workload on the VM, both Guest OS (actual) and Application
DESCRIPTION += metrics are reported back to CB's Metric Store, makes it
DESCRIPTION += also an interesting "sanity check" workload.
