Lists all VMs currently attached to a CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmlist <cloud name> [state = all|pending|finished|failed]

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) vmlist TESTCLOUD 
	The following VMs are attached to this cloudbench experiment (Cloud TESTCLOUD) :
	|name          |role                |size        |cloud_ip        |host_name            |vmc_pool            |ai      |aidrs      |svm_stub_vmc
