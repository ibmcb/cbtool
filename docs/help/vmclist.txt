Lists all VMCs (belonging to a Cloud) currently attached to a CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmclist <cloud name> [state = all|pending|finished|failed]

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) vmclist TESTCLOUD
	The following VMCs are attached to this cloudbench experiment (Cloud TESTCLOUD) :
	|name                    |host_count      |pool                    |cloud_hostname                  |cloud_ip         
	|test_host2              |1               |sut                     |test_host2                      |82.243.225.207   
	|test_host3              |1               |sut                     |test_host3                      |13.111.51.228
