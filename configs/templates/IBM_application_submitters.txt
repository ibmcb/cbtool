# Cloud-agnostic AIDRS templates
[AIDRS_TEMPLATES]
# TYPE: AI type to be deployed
# MAX_AIS: Maximum number of AIs generated by this AI Deployment Request Submitter that can be present at a given time.
# IAIT: Random distributions specifying inter-AI arrival time
# LIFETIME: Random distributions specifying AI lifetime
# LOAD_LEVEL: Random distributions specifying load level
# LOAD_DURATION: Random distributions specifying duration of each load level
#    IAIT, LIFETIME, LOAD_LEVEL and LOAD_DURATION has multiple formats:
#       randomly distributed values : <distribution name>I<average>I<std dev>I<max>I<min>
#           example: LOAD_DURATION = uniformIXIXI60I90
#       for fixed values :
#           example: LOAD_DURATION = 73
#       monotonically growing/decreasing values <initial value>(+,-,*,/)<factor>
#           example: LOAD_DURATION = 0+10
