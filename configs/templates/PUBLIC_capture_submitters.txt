# Cloud-agnostic VMCRS templates

# SCOPE: AI type or AI parent pattern to be captured
# MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_CAP_REQS: Maximum number of capture requests generated by this VM Capture Request Submitter that can be present at a given time.
# MAX_TOTAL_CAP_REQS: Maximum number of capture requests generated by this VM Capture Request Submitter.
# MIN_CAP_AGE: Minimum lifetime to consider a VM as eligible to be captured.
# IVMCAT: Random distributions specifying inter-VM capture request arrival time
#       randomly distributed values : <distribution name>I<average>I<std dev>I<max>I<min>
#           example: IVMCAT = uniformIXIXI60I90
#       for fixed values :
#           example: IVMCAT = 73
#       monotonically growing/decreasing values <initial value>(+,-,*,/)<factor>
#           example: IVMCAT = 0+10
